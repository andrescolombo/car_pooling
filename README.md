# Car Pooling Service Challenge

Design/implement a system to manage car pooling.

Provide the service of taking people from point A to point B.
So far we have done it without sharing cars with multiple groups of people.
This is an opportunity to optimize the use of resources by introducing car pooling.

You have been assigned to build the car availability service that will be used
to track the available seats in cars.

Cars have a different amount of seats available, they can accommodate groups of
up to 4, 5 or 6 people.

People request cars in groups of 1 to 6. People in the same group want to ride
in the same car. You can take any group at any car that has enough empty seats
for them. If it's not possible to accommodate them, they're willing to wait until
there's a car available for them. Once a car is available for a group
that is waiting, they should ride.

Once they get a car assigned, they will journey until the drop off, you cannot
ask them to take another car (i.e. you cannot swap them to another car to
make space for another group).

In terms of fairness of trip order: groups should be served as fast as possible,
but the arrival order should be kept when possible.
If group B arrives later than group A, it can only be served before group A
if no car can serve group A.

For example: a group of 6 is waiting for a car and there are 4 empty seats at
a car for 6; if a group of 2 requests a car you may take them in the car.
This may mean that the group of 6 waits a long time,
possibly until they become frustrated and leave.

## API

To simplify the challenge and remove language restrictions, this service must
provide a REST API which will be used to interact with it.

This API must comply with the following contract:

### GET /status

Indicate the service has started up correctly and is ready to accept requests.

Responses:

* **200 OK** When the service is ready to receive requests.

### PUT /cars

Load the list of available cars in the service and remove all previous data
(reset the application state). This method may be called more than once during
the life cycle of the service.

**Body** _required_ The list of cars to load.

**Content Type** `application/json`

Sample:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "seats": 4
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "seats": 6
  }
]
```

Responses:

* **200 OK** When the list is registered correctly.
* **400 Bad Request** When there is a failure in the request format, expected
  headers, or the payload can't be unmarshalled.
